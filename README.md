# Memory Game Project

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Instructions

Click on a card to flip it over and see what picture is on the card. Click on a second card to flip it over and see what picture is on the second card. If the two cards are not a match they will flip back over. If they are a match they will stay flipped over.

Once all cards are matched you have won!

This is my submission for Project 2 for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree. Since this is a project for a course any pull requests will probably not be accepted.
